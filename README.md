# FilesOrganizer
### This is a java program to organize the cluttered files in the directory on the basis of their extensions and dump them into a single folder named by "extension"+"_files_collections"
### Kindly look at the refactoring-better-code branch for the working code. As i havent merged the full functional code to main.
